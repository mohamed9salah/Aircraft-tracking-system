# SolidWorks Design
In our project, we utilized SolidWorks to design a tower that holds camera apertures and the airport building. This design phase was crucial in ensuring that the physical components of our tracking system were optimally placed and secured for effective operation.
- Tower Design: The tower was meticulously designed to support multiple camera apertures, ensuring a wide range of visibility for aircraft tracking. The structural integrity of the tower was a primary focus to withstand various environmental conditions and provide stable camera support. ![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-12 at 00 38 35_f7ff1cb2](https://github.com/mohamed9salah/Aircraft-tracking-system/assets/138705468/857e3573-b6aa-4284-901c-5ae2c3cc7726)
- Airport Building: The airport building was designed to integrate seamlessly with the tower, providing a centralized location for system operations and monitoring. This building houses the necessary hardware, including servers, monitors, and communication equipment, to facilitate efficient tracking and data processing. ![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-12 at 00 39 43_93d6c5f0](https://github.com/mohamed9salah/Aircraft-tracking-system/assets/138705468/10bd7a46-571b-40db-ab9e-5205ffc3c652)
- By creating a detailed simulation environment in SolidWorks, we were able to visualize and test the placement of all components within the system. This simulation helped in identifying potential design flaws, optimizing camera angles, and ensuring that all equipment was correctly positioned for maximum efficiency.
