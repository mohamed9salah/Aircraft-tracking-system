# Aircraft-tracking-system
Developed aircraft tracking system
• Utilized Python programming language and OpenCV computer vision library 
for implementing the tracking algorithms.
• Integrated Raspberry Pi for overall system control and management. Connected 
and synchronized the detection laser and camera with servo motors for precise 
tracking.
• Designed a 3D-printed mechanism and a tower to hold the camera apparatus, 
simulating an airport environment.
